<p>When this test starts you will be presented with a sequence of digits appearing at the top of the screen. </p>
<p>Use the numberpad to enter those digits in the <strong>reverse</strong> of the order they were presented in.</p>
<p>Click the tick symbol, at the bottom right of the numberpad, when done. You will then be presented with the next sequence.<br/> You may also use the backspace symbol, at the bottom left of the numberpad, to delete miss-entered characters. </p>
<p>The first two items are examples, which won't let you enter the wrong answer and will allow you to repeat the sequence. <br/>
The numberpad will change from green to black when the examples are finished.</p>
<p>Before starting this test, please make sure that you aren't likely to be disturbed for the next 20 minutes. <br/>
This is a short-term memory test and being distracted at the wrong moment could result in you not seeing or forgetting the sequence presented at the start of each test item. </p>

<p>The test gives points for each number you get right and for getting their order correct. </p>
